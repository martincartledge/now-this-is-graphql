## Now This is GraphQL

### by Martin Cartledge

A mini-workshop on the basics of GraphQL

## Getting Started

- Open a new terminal window
- Change directory (`cd`) into the directory you would like this code to live
- Run this command in your terminal: `git clone {SSH or HTTPS address goes here}`
- `cd now_this_is_graphql/`
- Open code in IDE of your choice
- Inside your terminal run `npm install` and then `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your broswer (note: it will _not_ work yet, that is intentional)

## Important notes

For the best experience using GraphQL syntax and features, it is recommended that you install the GraphQL exstension in your IDE.

Click to download for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)

If you are using an IDE that is _not_ VSCode, I suggest highlighting the `#` character and then pressing `cmd` + `d` on mac or `crtl` + `d` on windows to select all GraphQL comments. This will help you quickly uncomment that code.

## Having trouble?

- Do you have [`node` installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)?
- Do you have [`npm` installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)?
- Did you remember to run `npm install` before you ran `npm start`?
