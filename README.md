## Now This is GraphQL

### by Martin Cartledge

A mini-workshop on the basics of GraphQL

## Getting Started

- Open a new terminal window
- Change directory (`cd`) into the directory you would like this code to live
- Run this command in your terminal: `git clone {SSH or HTTPS address goes here}`
- `cd now_this_is_graphql/`
- Open code in IDE of your choice
- Inside your terminal run `npm install` and then `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your broswer (note: it will _not_ work yet, that is intentional)
